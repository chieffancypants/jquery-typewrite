# jQuery TypeWrite Plugin

Very tiny, simple jQuery plugin to concatenate the characters in a string, one letter at a time.  Gives the appearance that someone is typing for you.

Simply needed a place to keep this for a small project.

## Usage:

```js
$('#input').typewrite('Your Text goes here');
```

It also supports a callback:

```js
$('#input').typewrite('Your text goes here', function() {
	$('form').submit();
});
```
